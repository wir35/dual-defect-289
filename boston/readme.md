## Boston Programs

The Boston programs are reverbs that are based on an 8x8 Feedback Delay
Network (FDN). The programs are named for the aspect of the algorithm that
can be modulated in each.

8x8 is a large network which quickly consumes all of the power available in the
processor (most other FDN-based reverbs that are available on the FV-1 use a
4x4 matrix). Since there is not really enough space left to embellish them with
the usual extras, these programs present an opportunity to explore FDN based
reverbs in a somewhat raw form.
