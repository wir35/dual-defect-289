for feedback, as it includes a low pass filter. Consider patching an output
to a filter and back to the right input for feedback.

| Ins   | Inputs summed to mono. |
| Outs  | Left is tap 1. Right is tap 2. |
| X     | Tap 1 time. |
| Y     | Tap 2 time. |
| Z     | Low pass filter cutoff on right input. |

#### 08 Mobius Reverb

A mono reverb adjustable from short to infinite reverb time. This patch is available
on both sections, so it's possible to use two instances as a stereo reverb. Offset
their time base controls a little so they are decorrelated.

This program also allows you to make your own reverb "feedback loop" by cross-patching
the feedback outputs (right side) through analog effects and into each other's
feedback inputs. Use the Z knobs to keep the feedback under control. Try using
filters, equalizers, phasers, frequency shifters, limiters, gates, etc in the loop
for special effects.

| Control | Usage |
|-------|------------------------------------
| Ins   | Left: signal in. Right: feedback in. |
| Outs  | Left: reverb signal out. Right: feedback signal out. |
| X     | Reverb time. |
| Y     | Predelay time. |
| Z     | Feedback output level. |
| Time  | Increases size. Decreases bandwidth. |
| Regen | Not recommended on left. Right maybe. |
| Bal   | Mix dry and wet signal on left side. Right at 100% if using feedback. |

| Ins   | Stereo inputs. |
| Outs  | Stereo outputs. |
| X     | Reverb time. |
| Y     | Distance to source, left side. |

Medium sized, stereo reverb with controllable modulation of internal delay
lines in the FDN. Modulation can be adjusted from subtle to excessive.

| Outs  | Stereo outputs. |
| X     | Reverb time. |

#### 06 Time (Medium)

The time programs can be delays, reverbs or any combination in between.
An imbalanced FDN has several short delay lines and two long.
The time of the long delays can be modulated from short (reverb-like) to
long (echo-like). Reverb time controls the regeneration of both long and
short delays. Heavy modulation of delay time will dump time-warped,
deranged warble into the reverb network.

| Outs  | Stereo outputs. |
| X     | Reverb time. |

| Bal   | Blend dry and wet signals if desired. |

#### 07 Time (Large)

The time programs can be delays, reverbs or any combination in between.
An imbalanced FDN has several short delay lines and two long.
The time of the long delays can be modulated from short (reverb-like) to
long (echo-like). Reverb time controls the regeneration of both long and
short delays. Heavy modulation of delay time will dump time-warped,
deranged warble into the reverb network.
