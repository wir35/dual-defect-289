#### 05 Diffuse (Medium)

Concert hall algorithm with high internal diffusion. Creates a very
full and thick reverberation that builds slowly in density. The tone control is
bassy when low and bright when high. This also affects the reverberation time so
that lower or higher frequencies dwell longer. This program uses sizes close to
the original algorithm.

This program allows very deep, random modulation of the internal diffusors.
Keep the modulation depth at lower settings for more naturalistic reverb,
or high for special effects.

#### 06 Diffuse (Large)

Concert hall algorithm with  high internal diffusion. Creates a very
full and thick reverberation that builds slowly in density. The tone control is
bassy when low and bright when high. This also affects the reverberation time so

original algorithm that have been scaled up to more fully utilize all of the
available delay memory.
