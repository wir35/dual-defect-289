## Waltham Programs

The Waltham programs are a simplified interpretation of the concert hall program
from one of the well known early digital reverbs.

The parameters for reverb time and equalization are greatly simplified to
accommodate the small number of controls. The original four controls are
combined into one reverb time control and one tone control which tilts the reverb
from being low to high end focused. The tone control is in the feedback path,
so it also affects the reverberation time of the affected frequencies.
